# visualization
Freenet plugin

The Visualization plugin shows a simple graph depicting the Freenet storage system. The graph consists of a circle upon which bubbles and a square are placed. The square represents the computer itself, which, if the network is configured and running the Freenet, is linked to appearing and disappearing bubbles on the circle. The appearance and disappearance of the bubbles on the circle represent active connections to the computer through which data packets are sent or received. Within the Darknet Freenet mode, the location of the computer changes, and so changes the location of the square on the circle.
